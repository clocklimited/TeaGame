# TeaGame

## Object of the game
To decide who makes the tea.

## Dealer & Exemption
A player becomes exempt when they lose a game. They are able to use this exemption to become the Dealer on a subsequent game. Exemptions can't be carried over a weekend, unless the player who is exempt is able to find 3 other players who can confirm their exempt status.

The Dealer of a game can be one or many players who are exempt. If there are multiple dealers, then the deck is split between them and non-exempt players take a card from each dealer.

## Set Up
The loser of any previous games.. "The tea making loser" (dealer) shuffles and fans the cards out to be chosen.

## Let's Play
Each player picks a card.

The person who draws the lowest card is the loser, and must make the tea/coffee for every player.

They must ask all players their preferred drink out of Tea or Coffee, then take all cups down to the kitchen.

Instructions on players preferences can be found on the kitchen board.

Although they are the loser they have the added benefit of being exempt from making the tea in the next game, as they become the dealer.

## Functions of the Action Cards
If a player pulls the 'Action Card':

#### Queen of Hearts
They must collect monies from players, or use the biscuit fund, and buy the biscuits (within 48 hours).

#### Blank Card
The blank card reverses the results of a normal tea game, making the player with the highest card lose.

#### Joker
The player is exempt for the rest of the day, unless they draw a Joker again, causing automatic loss. If a blank card is pulled in the same game that a Joker is pulled, the Joker still exempts the player and they do not lose the game.

If a player is joker exempt and they pull a blank joker in another game that
day, then that player is no longer exempt for the rest of the day, but does not
lose that game.

## Draw
In what turns out to be, the unlikely event of a draw. the two (or more) players must play a face-off. All cards are returned to the dealer, who shuffles the pack and again fans the cards for the 2 (or more) tied players. They compete (lowest card again loses), this is repeated until a loser is decided.

## Fair Play
Fair play must ensue, and underhand play will result in a forfeit decided by the majority group.

## The Pack
As long as agreed, any pack of cards (small or large) may be used.

## Guest Players
Players not in the usual crowd (above) can play as along as agreed by the above, and provided they abide by the rules.

## Incorrect Tea Orders
If an incorrect tea order has been delivered it must be replaced by the correct tea order as soon as the error is reported to the tea maker. It is the responsibility of the tea maker to keep track of all tea orders.

## Tea Delivery Time
If a player knows that they can't start making the tea within 10 minutes of the game ending, then they should announce this before play begins. This gives other players the opportunity to withdraw from the game if wanted. If a player does not announce this, and it is evident that they knew of their time delay before the game began, then the player forfeits their exemption.

## 'Bring out your dead' Rule
After the game has been played, the losing player must collect the other players old cups and mugs.
Winning players can request a clean mug or offer the loser the option to reuse their old mug.

## Knocking rule
Players may wish to submit their tea order by knocking according to one of the codes listed below:

| Code                               | Order                   |
| ---------------------------------- |-------------------------|
| One knock                          | Coffee, milk            |
| One knock + # set of finger taps   | Coffee, milk, # sugars  |
| Two knocks                         | Tea, milk               |
| Two knocks + # set of finger taps  | Tea, milk, # sugars     |

## Evolving Game
New rules can be implemented but must be agreed by at least 3 players, by the means of a +1 on a pull request.

## New Rules
When a player has lost and must make the drinks, in order to validate their exemption for the next game they wish to play, they must rely on three other players to remember that they lost. Over long time periods such as at the end of the day or Christmas - it is wise to detail the exemption somewhere! If at least three players cannot verify the player losing, then he/she forfeits their exemption, and exemption is void.
It is also noted that attempting to actively "skank" (refuse) a legitimate exemption claim is not wise as it has previously resulted in active tea game players retiring from the game early in their career.
