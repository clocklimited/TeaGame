{"name":"Teagame","tagline":"Rules and documents associated with the Tea Game","body":"# TeaGame\r\n\r\n## Object of the game\r\nNot to be the player with the lowest card (ace is high) or to be the player holding a red Queen.\r\n\r\n## Dealer\r\nThe dealer can be 1 or more players. They are the loser of any previous games. and can be carried across any unparticipated games (absent or 'not up for it!' (named the Loomis rule!))\r\n\r\n## Set Up\r\nThe loser of any previous games.. \"The tea making loser\" (dealer) shuffles and fans the cards out to be chosen.\r\n\r\n## Let's Play\r\nEach player picks a card.\r\n\r\nThe person who draws the lowest card is the loser, and must make the tea/coffee for every player.\r\n\r\nThey must ask all players their preferred drink out of Tea or Coffee, then take all cups down to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nInstructions on players preferences can be found on the kitchen board.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are the loser they have the added benefit of being exempt from making the tea in the next game, as they become the dealer.\r\n\r\n## Functions of the Action Cards\r\nIf a player pulls the 'Action Card':\r\n\r\n    Queen of Hearts\r\n    They must collect monies from players, or use the biscuit fund, and buy the biscuits (within 48 hours).\r\n\r\n    Joker\r\n    The player is exempt for the rest of the day, unless they draw a Joker again, causing automatic loss.\r\n\r\n## Draw\r\nIn what turns out to be, the unlikely event of a draw. the two (or more) players must play a face-off. All cards are returned to the dealer, who shuffles the pack and again fans the cards for the 2 (or more) tied players. They compete (lowest card again loses), this is repeated until a loser is decided.\r\n\r\n## Fair Play\r\nFair play must ensue, and underhand play will result in a forfeit decided by the majority group.\r\n\r\n## The Pack\r\nAs long as agreed, any pack of cards (small or large) may be used, if accepted by the 'Official Players'.\r\n\r\n## Guest Players\r\nPlayers not in the usual crowd (above) can play as along as agreed by the above, and provided they abide by the rules.\r\n\r\n## Evolving Game\r\nNew rules can be implemented but must be agreed by all official players (including any guest players - if affected)\r\n\r\n## New Rules\r\nWhen a player has lost and must make the drinks, he/she must write their name on the whiteboard to validate the exemption. If their name is not written by the time the next game is raised, then he/she forfeits their exemption, and exemption is void (no-one is exempt (except if dual exemption applies, the player's middle name contains a silent \"h\", or the day of the previous game fell on Norwegian Independence Day.))\r\n\r\n## Highest Losing Card\r\nThe highest losing card to date, was the Queen-Spades picked by Adam on 4th Sept 2007 (against 3 Aces and a Joker)\r\n\r\n## Most Jokers Drawn\r\nThe highest number of Jokers drawn in one day to date, 5 Jokers pulled on 4th Sept 2007\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
